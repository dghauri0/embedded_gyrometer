Distance trackers on our wearable devices use a multitude of sensors to measure how far we walk (GPS, accelerometer, etc). As such, the third parties that manufacture these devices are capable of recording sensitive data about us for a seemingly trivial task: Just tell us how far we went! </br> </br>
This data can be sold to third parties, governments, etc. This project's goal is to use only the on-board MEMS gyrometer to locally process distance traveled for the user in 20-second intervals.
